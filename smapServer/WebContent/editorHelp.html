	   			<h2>Clicking on a question type in the toolbar</h2>
	   			<p>This will add that type of question to the very end of the survey.</p>
	   			<h2>Dragging a question type from the tool bar over a blue <b>add question </b>bar</h2>
	   			<p>This will place the new question where you drop it.</p>
	   			<h2>Click on one of the blue <b>add question</b> bars</h2>
	   			<p>This will create a <b>text</b> type question at the location you clicked.  You can then

	   			</h1>
	   			<p>Checks are made for the following errors and warnings:</p>
	   			<ul>
	   				<li>Errors
		   				<ul>
		   					<li>An empty name </li>
		   					<li>Invalid characters, such as spaces, in the name </li>
		   					<li>A <b>question</b> name that is not unique across the entire survey </li>
		   					<li>A <b>choice</b> name that is not unique within its choice list </li>
		   					<li>A reference to another question that does not exist, 
		   						for example including the answer to another question in the label</li>
		   					<li>A mismatched number of parenthesis in a relevance, constraint or calculation</li>
		   				</ul>
		   			</li>
		   			<li>Warnings
		   				<ul>
		   					<li>A blank label (except for groups or sub forms) </li>
		   				</ul>
		   			</li>
	   			</ul>
	   			<h2>Validating on save</h2>
	   			<p>The editor tries to spot errors as you make them and then give immediate feedback. Hence as soon as you
	   			type an invalid character into a question name then the error message will be shown.  However for performance
	   			reasons sometimes error checking has to wait until you save the survey.  For example you might delete a question
	   			without any errors being shown.  However somewhere else in your survey another question refers to the deleted
	   			question. This error will only show up when you press the <b>Save</b> button or select the "Validate" option from the
	   			file menu</p>
	   			
	   			<h2>Reviewing errors and warnings</h2>
	   			<p>If an error is detected while you are changing a question (or a choice) then the question is highlighted and an 
	   			error message is shown</p>
	   			<p>If there are errors detected when you click the save button or validate the survey then the number of errors and 
	   			warnings are shown in the <b>toolbar</b> along with a button that will take you to the next error.

	   			</h1>
	   			<p>Once you save a survey it is ready to be used.  Any person who has an "enumerator" access to the project,
	   			where you created your new survey, will be able to download the survey to fieldTask and start collecting data</p>
	   			<p>There is also a <b>test</b> button that will open the survey in webforms and allow you to try it out without having to 
	   			leave the editor.</p>

	   				padding-right: 0.5em;">Publishing and un-publishing your survey</a>
	   			</h1>
	   			<h2>Publishing</h2>
	   			<p>When you start creating a new survey form it is <b>not</b> published.  However as soon as you submit the
	   			first completed survey from fieldTask or webForms is is considered to be published.  This means data has
	   			been collected for the survey and some additional restrictions will be placed on the editor.
	   			<ul>
	   			<li>You will not be able to change the name of a question as this name identifies the column in the results
	   			table that holds the answers for that question.</li>
	   			<li>You will not be able to change the type of a question as Smap server can't store two different types of
	   			data in a single results column</li>
	   			<li>You can delete a question but its not really gone as the results gathered for that question are not deleted.
	   			Hence you won't be able to create another question with the same name as the deleted question unless it is also the
	   			same type, (text integer etc).
	   			</ul>
	   			<p>If you have modified a survey part way through collecting real data then you will just have to put up with the
	   			above restrictions.  However you will usually want to submit data while testing a survey so that you can see how the
	   			results will look during analysis. After you have done this you can <b>un</b>-publish the survey.</p>
	   			<h2>Un-Publish</h2> 
	   			<p>To un-publish you just need to delete all the data that has been submitted. (Careful here).</p><p>This is done in the 
	   			analysis dashboard where you can create a table panel for the survey, review the data that is there, then select the 
	   			<b>aside</b> using the <b><</b> button and press delete</p>
	   			<p>Once the survey has been unpublished the editing restrictions will be lifted</p>
